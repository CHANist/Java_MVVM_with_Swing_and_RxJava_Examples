== Introduction

There are a lot of different architectures for the GUI:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[*Model View Controller*],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter[*Model View Presenter*],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel[*Model View ViewModel*],
http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html[*PresentationModel*], ...

All of them try more or less

* to decouple the "different things" (widgets, forms, business logic, ...) from each other
* make the "different things" easily testable (unit-testable)
* try to separate presentation from behaviour
* make the view easily "exchangeable" (e.g. replace Swing with JavaFX)
* concentrate the business logic into e.g. the "model", which "lives longer" (in years) than the often changing GUI technologies
* ...

When you develop a Java Swing GUI in practice, you face the following additional challenges

* how to enforce the proper threading (view elements like JPanel, JButton, ... should be only accessed by AWT-EventDispatchThread)
* how to keep the view "responsive" by kicking off background actions (-> SwingWorker, new Thread(...), ExecutorService, ...)
* how to connect an ActionListener on e.g. a "Cancel" button with a just started SwingWorker and disconnect it after the SwingWorker finished
* how to combine the results from multiple asynchronous actions (multiple SwingWorker's, Thread's, Future's, ...) into one result for the view
* how to implement Undo/Redo, Validation, Exception-Handling, Timeouts, ...
* how to enforce acyclic relationships between "stuff" to get good (isolated) testability
* ...

So, which GUI architecture should you choose? What are the benefits and drawbacks in general? And for your current project?
What libraries are available to make "quick progress" and not reinvent the wheel?

These are a lot of questions which are IMO not easily answered for a Java Swing GUI.

=== The idea

One day, I had a deep lock at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel[*MVVM*] and came up with the idea of

* using https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava]'s http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html[Subject] objects as "listenable" value objects for the ViewModel
* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwing[RxSwing] to connect the View widgets (JButton, JTextField, ...) to the ViewModel-Subjects as "data binding"
* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] to react on changes of the ViewModel-Subjects and interact with the Model (backend)
* use RxJava's http://reactivex.io/documentation/scheduler.html[Scheduler] and the RxSwing https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwing/blob/0.x/src/main/java/rx/schedulers/SwingScheduler.java[SwingScheduler] to do the threading

I started with some small examples for different aspects. The solution was really nice IMO and I'd like to share it with you through this github repo.

== Implementing MVVM using RxJava and RxSwing

First, let's look at the "data flow" in MVVM:

image::MVVMPattern.png[]

* The View interacts with the ViewModel through DataBinding (this means in practise you don't see any method calls, listeners etc in your sourcecode, you just see "binding" code)
* The View doesn't interact with the Model
* The ViewModel interacts with the Model through ordinary Model API call's
* The Model API has some kind of callbacks to push data up to the ViewModel (dashed arrow)

Second, let's look at the dependencies:

image::MVVM_dependencies.png[]

* The View "sees" the ViewModel
* The View "doesn't see" the Model
* The ViewModel "sees" the model
* The Model "doesn't see" the ViewModel and "doesn't see" the View
* We have acyclic dependencies

==== Basic ideas behind the implementation of the examples here

* Threading
** All the action between View and ViewModel happens on the `SwingScheduler`
** All the action between ViewModel and Model happens on `Schedulers.io()` (= cached thread pool)

* View
** DataBinding
*** We add a little "Binder" fluent API a la https://github.com/canoo/open-dolphin/blob/master/subprojects/shared/src/main/groovy/org/opendolphin/binding/Binder.groovy[open-dolphin's Binder] on top of RxJava
** There is no other code than a) DataBinding code and b) plain GUI structure code in the View (= passive View)
** "Large" View's are composed by combining multiple "small" View's

* ViewModel
** Per View exits a ViewModel
*** The ViewModel represents the structure of the View 1:1
** We use http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html[Subject]'s as "fields" in the ViewModel
*** Each subject "field" in the ViewModel corresponds to one widget in the View
*** We use a little prefix for the "field" name like `v2vm_` or `vm2v_` to indicate the flow direction
*** We use the `BehaviorSubject` class for Subject instances, which is a stateful Subject to have the "current" state, an initial state and easy testability
** The ViewModel handles all the "complicated" interaction stuff between View and Model

* Model
** The Model doesn't care about it's presentation and just offers an API
** The Model is therefore fully focused on business logic and data

As you can see, there is no kind of "framework" described here to implement MVVM.
Instead, it's just the combination of standard JDK classes with the RxJava and RxSwing libraries,
together with some additional fluent API code for "nice" DataBinding.

== Examples

The examples start simple and get more and more complicated, adding additional aspects and features.

Scope: +
The *current* examples are all "everything in one process" examples: View, ViewModel and Model run in one process in the same JVM. +
Upcoming examples might include JavaFx, Android, Web and of course some kind of remoting to split "things" across multiple processes.

=== Example 1: Hello World (from the Model)

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example1[]

* The Model pushes "hello world's" thru an Observable to the ViewModel (using a computational thread)
* A JLabel in the View is bound to the `vm2v_info` field of the ViewModel
* The `RxViewModel2SwingViewBinder` code does the switch to the `SwingScheduler`

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example1[]

=== Example 2: Form submit

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example2[]

* A simple form submit of two textfields
* The ViewModel combines the two textfield values into one DTO and calls the Model API on a IO-Thread
* The `RxViewModel2ModelBinder` code does the switch to the `Schedulers.io()` scheduler

This example is the implementation of the initial idea:

=== Example 3: Form submit with Submit Button enabling

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example3[]

* Same as Example 2
* But: Submit button is only enabled, if both textfields contain a value

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example3[]

=== Example 4: Form submit with form disabling / reenabling

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example4[]

* Same as Example 3
* But: The form is completely disabled during the submit processing time

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example4[]

=== Example 5: Form submit with cancellation and classic "blocking" Model API

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example5[]

* Same as Example 4
* You can cancel the submit processing
* The model has a classic "blocking" API

image::example5.png[]

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example5[]

=== Example 5a: Form submit with cancellation and "non-blocking" Model API

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example5a[]

* Same as Example 5
* The model has a "non-blocking" API, the ViewModel gets simpler

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example5a[]

=== Example 6: Form submit with combining two asynchronous backend actions

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example6[]

* Same as Example 5a
* But with two model API calls running in two different threads
* Waiting for both of them
* Cancellation for both of them

image::example6.png[]

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example6[]

=== Example 7: Log table with LogRow's pushed up from the Model

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example7[]

* The model publishes `LogRow` s (using a computational thread)
* These are added in the view as rows of a `JTable` (using GUI thread)

image::example7.png[]

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example7[]

=== Example 8: Log table with LogRow's pushed up from the Model and dealing with backpressure

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example8[]

* The model uses a threadpool to create plenty of `LogRow` s (using as many threads as there are CPU cores)
* Since the view runs on a single thread, it can't keep up with the pace
** "Fast producer, slow consumer" kind of problem
* We need to think about backpressure
** We could slow down the `LogRow` production (blocking backpressure)
** Or we could drop the `LogRow` s which are "too much", keep up "full speed" and show only some of the `LogRow` s
** The example uses dropping

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example8[]

=== Example 9: Structural changes at runtime in the View (and GUI composition)

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example9[]

* So far the views were very static
* Now we have structural changes at runtime, think of a wizard with it's steps
* Parts of the views remain static (header, footer)
* Therefore we need some kind of view composition

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example9[]

=== Example 10: Composition of GUI's and communication from outer ViewModel's to inner ViewModel's

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example10[]

* View / ViewModel composition
** How can on "outer" component communicate with "inner" components?
*** How to propagate the "edit" state to the inner components?

image::example10.png[]

Tests:

link:./src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example10[]

=== Example 11: Composition of GUI's and communication from inner ViewModel's to outer ViewModel's (dirty flag, Save Button)

link:./src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/mvvm_rxjava/example11[]

* View / ViewModel composition
** How can on "inner" component communicate with an "outer" component?
*** "Dirty" flag of "inner" component enables the "Save" button of "outer" component
