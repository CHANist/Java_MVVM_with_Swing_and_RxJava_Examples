== Introduction

There are a lot of different architectures for the GUI described:
*Model View Controller*, *Model View Presenter*, *Model View ViewModel*, *PresentationModel*, ...

All of them try more or less

* to decouple the "different things" (widgets, forms, business logic, ...) from each other
* make the "different things" easily testable (unit-testable)
* try to separate presentation from behaviour
* make the view easily "exchangeable"
* concentrate the business logic into e.g. the model, which "lives longer" (in years) than the often changing GUI technologies
* etc...

When you develop a Java Swing GUI in practice, you face the following additional challenges

* how to enforce the proper threading (view elements like JPanel, JButton, ... only accessed by AWT-EventDispatchThread)
* how to keep the view "responsive" by kicking off background actions (-> SwingWorker, ...)
* how to connect an ActionListener on a e.g. a CancelButton with a just started SwingWorker
* how to easily cancel background actions (SwingWorker) if the GUI is closed or parts of the GUI are closed
* how to combine the results from multiple asynchronous actions (multiple SwingWorker's) into one result for the view
* how to enforce acyclic relationships between "stuff" to get good (isolated) testability
* ...

So, which GUI architecture should you choose? What are the benefits and drawbacks? What libraries are available to have "quick results"?

These are a lot of questions, which are not easily answered for a Java Swing GUI.

=== The idea

One day, I had a deep lock at MVVM and came up with the idea of

* using https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava]'s http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html[Subject] objects as "listenable" value objects for the ViewModel (aka PresentationModel)
* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwing[RxSwing] to connect (bind) the View widgets (JButton, JTextField, ...) to the ViewModel-Subjects
* plain RxJava to react on changes of the ViewModel-Subjects and interact with the Model (backend)
* use RxJava http://reactivex.io/documentation/scheduler.html[Scheduler] do the the threading

The solution was really nice and I'd like to share it with you through this github repo.
